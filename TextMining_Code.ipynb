A schoolgirl uniform this isn\\u2019t: fluted, folded or gathered, the skirts and dresses at Stella McCartney, Jason Wu and Roberto Cavalli are prepped for big-city success.\\n\\nIn 2010, Bella Heathcote, 24, got her ticket to ride when she won the Heath Ledger Scholarship, which helps Australian actors get a foothold in Hollywood.\\n\\nThis winter, Heathcote, who appeared in \\u201cDark Shadows,\\u201d will play a rock star\\u2019s girlfriend in \\u201cNot Fade Away,\\u201d the first movie by the \\u201cSopranos\\u201d creator David Chase.\\n\\nThe Australian actress Bella Heathcote hasn\\u2019t been in Hollywood for even two years and already she\\u2019s landed two leading roles \\u2014 the first in Tim Burton\\u2019s vampire flick \\u201cDark Shadows,\\u201d opposite Johnny Depp, and the second in David Chase\\u2019s directorial debut \\u201cNot Fade Away,\\u201d out in December. Recently, T caught up with the Vogue Australia cover girl on her drive back from the Hamptons International Film Festival, where Chase\\u2019s coming-of-age story about a rock band in 1960s New Jersey got great reviews. Here, she discusses a few of the high points (and the single low point) of her dizzying first years in Hollywood. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a weird world,\\u201d she says.\\n\\nQ.How did you get into acting?\\n\\nA. I did dancing and singing when I was little, and then when I was 12 years old my friends were taking speech and drama at school. They were private lessons, and I started doing that. Over the years everyone else dropped out and I just kept going. I loved it.\\n\\nMy dad was really supportive. My mum passed away when I was 12, so I think Dad was all for me being distracted. I don\\u2019t know that he thought speech and drama would lead to a career. At the time it was just an escape.\\n\\nHow was it on set with David Chase?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s funny, I\\u2019ve been doing a lot of interviews lately, and I\\u2019ve been trying to explain my feelings about him because I\\u2019m so fond of him. He\\u2019s just so lovely, and on set he was so great. If I was floundering around a bit, he knew what to say to put me back on track, and he could do that with anyone. I felt like I had a bit of a safety net there.\\n\\nAre you a big \\u201cSopranos\\u201d fan?\\n\\nI knew that if I watched it before I got the gig I\\u2019d be too intimidated. So I actually started watching \\u201cThe Sopranos\\u201d when I got home from work \\u2014 online \\u2014 and then would get up and go to work in the morning. I\\u2019m glad I hadn\\u2019t seen it because I would have been so intimidated by David and James [Gandolfini] as well. He\\u2019s extraordinary.\\n\\nSo how did you prepare for the role of Grace? Did you listen to a ton of the Rolling Stones?\\n\\nYeah I did, actually. The music was really helpful, and I guess I went the traditional route and did all the research about the period, worked with a coach. \\u2026\\n\\nYou pull off the \\u201960s and \\u201970s look pretty well. In both films.\\n\\nI remember at the time thinking, \\u201cI just want one of the costumes, and maybe Paramount will give me one if I ask really nicely?\\u201d but then I couldn\\u2019t decide which one I wanted.\\n\\nYou won the Heath Ledger Award, which helps young Aussies get a foothold in Hollywood, in 2010. What was the application process like?\\n\\nIn the end of 2009, my agent in Australia told me to apply and I remember looking at it and thinking it was too much work, and my agent was like, \\u201cJust do it.\\u201d It was like an online job application, a sort of essay-style thing, on why I thought I\\u2019d benefit from being in L.A. And then I attached a show reel and fortunately for me this film I did in Australia called \\u201cBeneath Hill 60\\u2033 came out in 2010 and they were willing to give me some scenes before they came out to show them. I hadn\\u2019t really done much else at that point. And then I must have gone out to L.A. in early 2010, and then in April or May I was told that I was a finalist. They would fly me out to L.A. again, they said. I just packed up all my stuff.\\n\\nWhat did it do for your career exactly?\\n\\nWell, my manager used it. It was nice to have something that was identifiable to talk about. During the first week there was an event with a bunch of Australians, a group of people who were really supportive. It was so sweet. There are a few girls out here that I\\u2019m friendly with now because of that. It\\u2019s nice, we all look out for each other.\\n\\nSo how do you like L.A.?\\n\\nI think it\\u2019s beautiful. I\\u2019ve lived by the beach and by the hills. I think you\\u2019ve got to be right where the nature is. I think for me, home needs to be a sanctuary. I need to feel like I\\u2019ve escaped the day when I get home.\\n\\nAnd how do you like the whole Hollywood scene?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s a weird world. At the New York Film Festival, you feel like everyone is really there for the films, but at Cannes it just felt like half the people were there because they wanted to meet a celebrity. It was funny to witness.\\n\\nYou\\u2019ve already gotten a total taste of the rumor mill \\u2014 last year Star Magazine claimed you got into a \\u201cnude scandal\\u201d with Brad Pitt.\\n\\nThat was so strange. I remember being in New York when it happened and my friend sent me an e-mail saying, \\u201cI can\\u2019t believe you didn\\u2019t tell me!\\u201d And then I went to Duane Reade and it was in Star Magazine. But I wasn\\u2019t bothered because it was just so far from the truth \\u2014 it was hilarious to me.\\n\\nHow was it seeing yourself on the cover of Vogue Australia\\u2019s September issue?\\n\\nI\\u2019ve only seen one hard copy. In Melbourne, when you go to the Melbourne Show, which is basically like a county fair for you guys, you can get a mock magazine cover made up with your face on it. I just feel like that\\u2019s what the Vogue issue is. It seems pretty unreal.\",\n          \"BUCKFIELD, Maine - The guys from Maine who became an online sensation by creating geysers from soda and Mentos candies have discovered it's not just entertainment. It can propel vehicles, as well.\\n\\nA contraption created by Fritz Grobe and Stephen Voltz of Buckfield using a bike and a trailer is powered by piston mechanism using hundreds of pieces of Mentos candy and Coke Zero.\\n\\nOn a video posted online Tuesday, the machine traveled more than 220 feet.\\n\\nThe video was directed by Rob Cohen of \\\"The Fast and the Furious.\\\" Grobe joked that the crew is calling it \\\"The Fizzy and the Furious.\\\"\\n\\nThe geyser experiment used Diet Coke.

Several states, including New York, have already implemented similar charges often referred to as \\u201csystem benefits\\u201d or \\u201cpublic benefits charges.\\u201d\\n\\nFrom the 1970s-90s, a similar charge on the interstate transport of natural gas was dedicated to fund the Gas Research Institute, a public-private research consortia responsible for numerous advancements, including a key role in the development of commercial shale gas extraction technologies.\\n\\nIn short, several strong precedents exists for the Energy Security Trust concept.\\n\\nMaking the Energy Security Trust a reality\\n\\nSo in general, it is high time we begin a serious conversation about how to generate the necessary, long-term investments in energy research and innovation necessary to address national imperatives including improved security of supply, reduced public health impacts of our energy system, and climate change mitigation. The Energy Security Trust may be a big step in the right direction.\\n\\nWith that in mind, the thing that worries me about President Obama\\u2019s proposed Energy Security Trust [is that] it is difficult to tell how serious he and his administration are about this concept \\u2014 or how likely this proposal is to work its way through a politically charged Congress.\\n\\nIf the White House is serious, they must know that the proposal as it currently stands, which does not envision opening up any new areas previously closed to oil and gas production, will not produce any new federal revenues, at least as far as the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is concerned.\\n\\nThe way CBO scores budgetary impacts already assumes revenues for any federal lands currently open to oil and gas production are part of the baseline revenue picture. That means that redirecting a portion of those revenues \\u2014 say $2 billion over ten years \\u2014 from existing areas open to oil and gas production is actually going to be scored by CBO as deficit enhancing, rather than deficit neutral as the president has been portraying this.\\n\\nAccording to the White House fact sheet on the Energy Security Trust:\\n\\n\\u201cThe mandatory funds [for the Trust] would be set aside from royalty revenues generated by oil and gas development in Federal waters of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), already included in the administration\\u2019s five year plan. These revenues are projected to increase over the next several years based on a combination of leasing, production, and price trends, with additional revenues potentially generated as a result of reforms being proposed in the FY 2014 Budget. The Trust is paid for within the context of the overall budget.\\u201d [emphasis added]\\n\\nThe problem with this concept is that even if oil and gas prices are likely to increase in the future, thus increasing federal revenues from oil and gas leases on public lands, any such revenue coming from areas already open to production will be considered by CBO as already included in the baseline revenue picture.\\n\\nSo the only piece of this proposal that may result in new revenues that CBO would consider as \\u201coffsets\\u201d for new spending would be the \\u201cadditional revenues potentially generated as a result of reforms being proposed in the FY 2014 Budget.\\u201d\\n\\nWhat those reforms would constitute is unclear. In response to an inquiry for additional details, a White House staffer told me that \\u201cthose reforms will be made clear when the [FY 2014] budget is released.\\u201d\\n\\nThe president likes to say that his Energy Security Trust \\u201cbuilds on a proposal supported by a broad bipartisan coalition, including retired military leaders.\\u201d The coalition he refers to is known as \\u201cSAFE\\u201d (for Securing America\\u2019s Future Energy), and he\\u2019s right that this idea was once embraced by the Republican side of the aisle. In fact, a 2008 energy blueprint released by House Republicans, the \\u201cAmerican Energy Act,\\u201d included the concept of a trust fund for advanced technology research funded by oil and gas royalties. The idea has been championed in particular by Representative Devin Nunes of California in the House and Senator Lisa Murkowksiof Alaska in the Senate.\\n\\nGiven these bipartisan bonafides, one might think this concept was a slam dunk.\\n\\nThe tricky situation though is that each of the Republican proposals envision dedicating royalty revenues from expanded domestic production of oil and gas, including opening up new areas previously closed to production in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) and places like the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).\\n\\nSo both the CBO budget procedures and the GOP\\u2019s position on using royalties for an energy R&D trust fund means that if President Obama wants to secure truly bipartisan support for this new Energy Security Trust proposal and ensure it doesn\\u2019t increase the deficit, he\\u2019s ultimately going to have to offer a real trade: new oil and gas production areas for new revenues dedicated to clean energy R&D.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Obama already agreed to open up new areas of the OCS for offshore oil and gas production in April 2010 \\u2014 and he did so without demanding any concessions from the GOP regarding the use of revenues for advanced energy R&D. He\\u2019s unlikely to get any credit for his previous actions in any new negotiations with Republicans, and even if he did, CBO\\u2019s scoring would now take into account revenues from these areas in the budget baseline.\\n\\nIn short, the president missed a big chance to put this energy trust fund into action in 2010. To get another chance now, he\\u2019ll have to find some new carrot to entice GOP cooperation.\\n\\nA rock and a hard place\\n\\nPresumably the president already knows all of this. So perhaps this is simply his opening bid, and he\\u2019s fully prepared in the future to make this a real deficit neutral proposal by offering new areas for oil and gas production in exchange for support from Congressional Republicans. I don\\u2019t doubt that Senator Murkowski would demand something like that, and the House GOP most certainly would. So maybe, for once, President Obama hasn\\u2019t pre-capitulated and is saving his cards for the negotiating table. But it\\u2019s not clear.\\n\\nEven if he can find a proposal palatable to the GOP, the idea may be doomed on his own side of the aisle. Given the current uproar over Canada\\u2019s tar sands and the Keystone XL pipeline as well as past pitched battles over expanded oil and gas production, I have a hard time imagining Congressional Democrats or their environmentalist supporters getting behind the idea of opening ANWR to oil and gas drilling.\\n\\nSo can President Obama find some new area in the OCS that is still closed to drilling which greens and Democrats will find palatable and will serve to entice a combative GOP to the table? Or will this Energy Security Trust end up stuck between a rock and a hard place?\\n\\nAnother option: raising royalty rates\\n\\nIf he can\\u2019t find new lands or waters to open to oil and gas production, the only other other alternative is to propose an increase in royalties and fees on existing oil and gas producing lands.\\n\\nAbout 594 million barrels of oil and 3,724 billion cubic feet of natural gas were produced on federal lands and waters in 2012, according to the Congressional Research Service.\\n\\nRaising $2 billion over ten years \\u2014 or a modest $200 million annually \\u2014 would thus require increasing royalties by just 15.8 cents per barrel of oil and 2.7 cents per million British thermal units (MMBtus) of natural gas (assuming the necessary revenues were spread across oil and gas on an equal energy-content basis). That\\u2019s an increase of less than 0.2 percent over current WTI crude oil prices and 0.7 percent over current NYMEX natural gas prices.\\n\\nBut he said the \\u201cconcept represents a significant bid to test the potential for advancing energy policy\\u201d \\u2014 if Obama continues to press the case and some Republican lawmakers see the merits in moving being \\u201cdrill baby drill.\\u201d\",\n          \"09/13/2015 AT 03:00 PM EDT\\n\\nLegendary newsman Dan Rather dropped his guard at the Toronto International Film Festival premiere of\\n\\nThe emotional moment came when an audience member asked if he would do anything differently. \\\"Journalism is not an exact science,\\\" he explained, continuing that there were \\\"plenty of things I would do over.\\\"\\n\\nrecreates the seminal events around Rather's 2006 ouster from CBS News after airing a highly controversial report on then-President George W.

A film called\\n\\nThe drama, which premiered to a standing ovation from the Toronto audience, focuses on Mapes and her relationship with Rather, said director James Vanderbilt. \\\"I was surprised to see how much they respected each other and cared for each other, and that's where I was able to hook into what I wanted the movie to be about.\\\"\",\n          \"If you\\u2019ve kept your shirt dry while canoeing the rivers of our current presidential campaign, it\\u2019s likely that you\\u2019ve been skilled enough to avoid the logjams and snags of \\u201cdishonesty\\u201d and \\u201clies\\u201d that the parties and press have flung into the water. While it\\u2019s true that politicians and their campaigns and their ads routinely lie \\u2014 I hear no disagreement on that point, so I\\u2019ll continue \\u2014 never have politicians and the press expressed such indignation at campaign exaggerations, fibs and falsehoods.\\n\\nFor example, after Representative Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) gave his acceptance speech this week at the Republican National Convention, the press corps fact-checkers instantly took hammers and tweezers to his address. \\u201cThe Most Dishonest Convention Speech \\u2026 Ever?\\u201d asked Jonathan Cohn in the liberal New Republic, but the non-partisan press accused Ryan of having misled listeners and taken \\u201cfactual shortcuts,\\u201d too. The Week counted up the 15 euphemisms for \\u201clying\\u201d the press (partisan and non-partisan) used to describe the speech.\\n\\nI suspect the growing sensitivity to political lies has less to do with more lying by more politicians than it does with the growth of the fact-checking industry over the last decade or so. Every campaign speech, big or small, every campaign ad, local or national, every fund-raising letter is fodder for the modern fact-checkers, who have multiplied in the pages of our newspapers like termites in breeding season: FactCheck.org (the granddaddy of these sites, from the Annenberg Public Policy Center, which got started in the mid-2000s) and the later arrivals PolitiFact (Tampa Bay Times), The Fact Checker (Washington Post), AP Fact Check (Associated Press) and CNN Fact Check, all of which run regular fact checks. Other news organizations muster ad hoc journalistic militias to grade the truth-value of political speech. Today\\u2019s New York Times piece, \\u201cFacts Take a Beating in Acceptance Speeches,\\u201d does that for the Republican National Convention.\\n\\nAs much as I applaud the fact-checker profession \\u2014 it\\u2019s vital for politicians to know that we know that they know they\\u2019re lying \\u2014 the enterprise is a mug\\u2019s game. Of course politicians and their campaigns lie. Of course they continue to lie even when called out. If you think otherwise, you\\u2019re looking for truth in all the wrong places.\\n\\nPoliticians engage in deliberative rhetoric on the stump, in legislative speeches and in campaign commercials. Their primary goal is to convince audiences that their positions are right, and persuade them to vote, make campaign donations, echo their support, recruit additional supporters or take some other action. Truth-telling would matter a lot more to politicians if it were as effective in persuading people as truth-bending. Plus, trapping the truth and serving it in a palatable form to an audience is damn hard, as any university professor can tell you. It\\u2019s easier and more effective for campaigns to trim, spice and cook facts to serve something tastier, even if they must brawl with the fact-checkers in the aftermath.\\n\\nYou might as well fact-check a sermon as fact-check a campaign speech. Neither are exercises in finding the truth. That doesn\\u2019t mean we can excuse political lies. Please take a mallet to Romney\\u2019s fallacious assertion that Obama ended work requirements for welfare and to the Obama campaign\\u2019s ad that misstated Romney\\u2019s views on abortion. I pair these two fact checks not just to declare moral equivalence between the two parties or candidates but to demonstrate that the mutual-aggression pacts that govern politics make futile the fact-checking machinations of journalists. Give them a million billion Pinocchios and they\\u2019ll still not behave. Remember, the Republican-on-Republican fact-action was hairier during the primaries, when more desperate candidates were in the race. See also the 2008 Democratic Party and Republican Party campaigns for presidential nominations, when most of the candidates were eager to say the least defensible things about their fellow party members if that gave them a better shot at the ticket. Like in 2008, when Mike Huckabee unveiled to the press a scurrilous 30-second attack ad calling Mitt Romney too dishonest to be president, but then, as a statement against gutter politics, vowed not to air it.\\n\\nJournalists, even of the fact-checking variety, like to imagine they\\u2019re in the grandstands, watching and commenting on the action, when they\\u2019re actually part of the game. As the Washington Post reports today, far from deploring the process, the candidates enjoying gaming the fact-checkers to their advantage. \\u201cThe Obama campaign has tasked one media officer to deal exclusively with fact checkers\\u2019 questions, and top Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom often personally handles requests,\\u201d says the piece. Brooks Jackson, FactCheck.org director, who produced fact-check journalism for CNN during the 1992 presidential election, expresses his worries that campaigns have come to regard their head-butting with fact-checkers as a kind of badge of honor. It\\u2019s like raising a naughty kid who enjoys time-outs.\\n\\nFact-checking, explains the Post, is not for politicians but for voters. I suppose fact-checking would matter more to voters if they expected honesty from their politicians. But most don\\u2019t. Instead of vetted policy lectures, voters crave rhetoric that stirs their unfact-checked hearts. As long as the deception is honest, pointing in the direction they want to go, they\\u2019re all rght with it.\\n\\nSend fact checks to Shafer.Reuters@gmail.com and craven rhetoric to my Twitter feed.
